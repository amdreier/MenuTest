# MenuTest
This is my first personal project, written in C++ along with the Qt framework to produce an interactive menu selection application. 
The purpose was to serve as a self-taught venture into GUIs with C++ and gain experience working with a GUI framework.

Menu Test.zip contains the application, however, as I don't have a lisence as a MacOS developer, to run the application you must allow it to run through the security settings.
The source code is contained in MenuTest.zip, and this code can be compiled in Qt Creator.
